<h1>My Profile</h1>

<h2>A bit about me</h2>

<p> My name is Elisha Rackley. I am currently studying at RMIT through Open Universities Australia. I am Australian and have lived in Australia my whole life. My first and only language is English.</p>

<p>I am currently limited on education with only a Certificate II in Live Entertainment and my Year 12 Certificate.</p>

<p>A bit of a fun fact about me is that I have eight siblings and I love cats. At the moment, I only have one cat and he is completely black which is what I love most about him because I hate the stigmatism around black cats.</p>

<h2>IT and Me</h2>

<p>There are many fields of IT that I find particularly interesting including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and application development. All three are fields that have endless possibilities and opportunities which is what I find particularly appealing about them. Each of these sectors can be merged and pulled about with and from other sectors. The rules of IT are constantly evolving with merging technologies meaning that the field I could be working in in ten years’ time, might not exist yet.</p> 

<p>My interest in IT doesn't have a particular starting point as growing up in Generation Z meant, for me, that IT was as much a part of life as walking and talking. When I was young, I was told that I was a part of "iGen" and that was cemented by the fact that I rarely found an IT problem that I could not solve. People commended me for ability to work and fix these 'magical devices' which has always felt misplaced as it was though they were commending me for finishing a twelve-piece puzzle; not at all difficult and certainly not worthy of gratitude.</p> 

<p>Both my uncle and one of my mother's partners from a few years ago sparked my interest in a career in IT as what they did for a living earnt them a decent penny and looked like a satisfying day of work. In order to confirm my thoughts, I completed work experience with my uncle- working on a program for invoices that automatically picks up on the various figures. This program not only saved employees from entering GST and total amounts on invoices manually but saved companies’ money in manual labor.</p>  

  
<p>When I was tossing up studying IT, it was my old boss who pointed me in the direction of RMIT as his son studied at RMIT and is currently working in New York. After looking further into it, I found that I could study online at RMIT through Open Universities Australia, who I have previously studied through so I went for it.

<h2>Future Possibilities</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51029022?type=standout#searchRequestToken=cffeb174-4c6c-4a63-9db9-431cc5398e8">Mobile Application Developer-SEEK</a></p>

<p>This position is for a mobile application developer to create new applications for both iOS and Android platforms. This position is particularly appealing as it offers job stability as it is a full-time permanent role. Another appealing aspect is the work culture that it offers- one that is flexib</p> 

<p>This position requires a strong understanding of JavaScript and the ability to apply it on various platforms. This experience and understanding are an essential part of fulfilling this role. Prior experience in a similar role is highly desirable but not essential, as long as the candidate meets the requirements of using and applying Java. Similarly, a degree in Information Technology or Computer science is highly desirable but, again, not essential. In order to excel in this role, you must be a team player who is able to effectively communicate their ideas.</p>   

<p>Written between the lines of the position description is that the ideal person is open and bubbly in order to fit in with the work environment that has already been established.</p>  

<p>Whilst I currently have experience using android platforms in my personal life and iOS platforms in my professional life, I will still need more in-depth knowledge of the platforms and how they interact with software. Whilst I also have what is, essentially, an introductory understanding of Java from studying ‘Intro to Programming’ with RMIT, the foundation is there to build upon and explore.</p> 

<p>A basic plan that would prepare me and qualify me for this position includes learning Java to a point where I can proficiently apply it in other applications including  React Native, Vue.JS, React.JS, Jest and TypeScript.  As well as completing a bachelor of IT which will give me the formal qualifications and continuing to purse my career in IT in service desk but gradually moving up into an application position.

<h2> Personality, Learning Style and Team Role</h2>

<h3>Personality- www.16personalities.com  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16 Personalities</a> </h3>

<h5>Campaigner </h5>

<h3>Learning Style- <a href="https://https://www.how-to-study.com/learning-style-assessment">Learning Style Assessment</a></h3>

<h5>Visual <h5>

<h3> Team Role -<a href="https://www.123test.com/team-roles-test/">123 Test</a></h3>

<h5>Explorer 23% and Driver 17%</h5>

<p>
The results of the '16 Personalities' test are incredibly accurate and hit pretty close to home but the results of the learning style and what my role is in a team does not surprise me. The 16 Personalities result hit me so hard as I had never found anything that describes and explains me so well.
</p>

<p>When it comes to being a part of a team, the 16 Personalities results were right in saying that, as a campaigner, there is a certain tendency to come across as being a leader or the desire to be when in reality, leadership is not what a campaigner wants as they see it as a boring position due to the administrative tasks that come with it.  These results are then backed up by the results of the 123 Test to see what role I play in a team which is the explorer, closely followed by the driver. </p>

<p>Due to my explosive and extroverted nature that is clearly highlighted through these personality test, the ideal team does not have more than one of me or my kind as it is inefficient to getting work done as my role in the team is to 'explore', part of that means to help paint a picture with everyone's ideas and input. Despite this coming across as something a leader might do, I would prefer someone else take the leadership role.</p>

<h2>The Smart Fan</h2>

<h3>The smart fan- a pedestal fan with more control. </h3>

<p>An Australian summer staple, the pedestal fan, but let us bring it into the 21st Century by making it smarter. The smart fan will be controllable through voice and mobile devices connected to smart home systems. A mobile app will be paired to the fan and act as a remote so that the user can set the fan to different modes including speeding, timer and temperature control. </p>

<p>The inspiration or selling point behind this particular smart fan, are the people who require a fan to fall asleep. Whether it be because they do not have an air conditioner in the bedroom, or they need it for the white noise.</p>
 
<p>According to the Bureau of Meteorology (Climate statistics for Australian locations, 2020), Melbourne has an average daily maximum temperature of over 22°C between the months of November to March. However, the average minimum temperature for January and February is below 16.4°C in and below 14.6°C for March, November and December. Given that the coldest time of the day is just after the sun rises according to Mikhaela Singleton from wrbl.com (Singleton, 2020), it is unideal to have a fan on at this time. This is where the timer or the local weather override on the app is a feature. No one wants to wake up in 15*C weather with a fan on but with the smart fan, they can set it to turn off in 2 hours, at 12am or when the local weather drops below 18*C for instance. It is this local weather control feature that distinguishes this fan from any other smart fan currently on the market.</p>

<p>In the Australian climate, fans are an essential part of summer. The fan will, for the most part, look and act like a standard pedestal fan. With a three pronged metal base, a height adjustable centre pole and four fan blades covered by a protection frame. However as opposed to a standard fan with a switch controlling four settings of 'off', 'low', 'medium' and 'high', there will just be and 'on' and 'off' button to act as the override. This button will also be used to sync the fan to the smart system. For instance, the button needs to be pressed five times to go into pairing mode. Once it is in pairing mode, the fan can be connect to the mobile app. 
 
<p>The app itself will be basic but as user friendly as it can be without restraining the product. Upon initial app start up, there will be a log in/register screen which will be by passed once account is set up and registered to device. From there, the main screen will act as a remote with a menu option in the top left corner and an 'Add' button in the top right hand corner. In the side menu, the very top item will display user profile which is not selectable and will ideally be in a darker colour to the other items. The first selectable tab will be 'Home', which takes the user back to the main screen. Below that will be 'Account', where you can see and update profile information. This will also be where you can see where your profile is connected to, such as Google Home or Alexa. The next tab will be for settings, where the user can control their time and location manually or through phone and location services. The smartphone app connected to the fan will also have location services and you can set it to turn off when it gets to a certain temperature according to local weather.  </p>

<p>The 'smart' part of the fan would be built upon a standard pedestal fan and Raspberry Pi technology, predominantly it's Wi-Fi capabilities to communicate with a smart phone app; an app that would essentially act as a remote. The app can then be linked to smart devices such as Google Home or Alexa to increase smart home potential.  </p>

<p>In order for this project to be successful, it would, at the very least need a mobile software application developer or a team of developers to develop the mobile application to control the fan. The fan itself would need a programmer to program the Raspberry Pi within the fan so that it can communicate with the app. 

As the fan needs a power source, an electrician would most likely have to sign off  on it being compliant and evaluate how much power the fan consumes.

The fan parts, including the stand, centre arm, fan blades and protection frame could all be locally sourced. However that will add to overall costs which means the product will be sold at a higher price as opposed to the price that could be offered if the product was outsourced to another country.</p>

<p>Ideal outcome would be an affordable household product that bring an Australian household staple into the 21st Century. Ideally it would be sold at all major homeware and tech retailers, including Kmart, Big W, JB Hi-Fi. Advertised and marketed to people just trying to sleep on warm nights and not wake up cold in the morning.</p>
